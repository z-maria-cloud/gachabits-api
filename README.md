# Gachabits API

A library of words to be used in random generators.

Gachabits contains 600+ words. By deciding how to combine these words we can generate many kinds of things, for example clothing items, characters, food, magic weapons, spells and many more.

I mainly use Gachabits to spark creative ideas on what to draw or what to write about.
